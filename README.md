# Billboard-100-App
This Python project allows users to interact with a collection of songs by different artists through text commands. Users can request specific songs, all songs by an artist, or a random song selection. Additionally, users have the option to choose a "Top Hit" for a given artist. The program validates the command input, ensuring it follows the expected format, and provides helpful feedback for incorrect inputs.

Features

Top Hit Option: Users can choose the "Top Hit" for an artist if available.
Error Handling: The program provides descriptive error messages for incorrect commands, guiding users toward valid inputs.
